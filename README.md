# Kickstarting Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
  The purpose of this project was to aid Louise in launching her play called _Fever_. This assistance could be provided by analyzing the data from past kickstarter projects that were plays. The outcomes of these projects could then be compared to both the launch dates and monetary goals of the various campaigns in order to determine a reasonable amount of money to ask for and when best to launch the kickstarter.
